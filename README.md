> **v1.15.0:** codingStandard now provides validated runtime resources for **20 locales**. Non-English runtime locales use English as the fallback language when a localized resource is unavailable.
>
> **Repository model:** `codingStandard-private` is the development source of truth. Validated releases are promoted through `codingStandard-dev` to the stable public [`eaglesjo/codingStandard`](https://github.com/eaglesjo/codingStandard) repository.

## ✨ What is AI Engineering Standard?

`codingStandard` is a reusable engineering standard for AI-assisted development, model training, experimentation, LLM/Vision workflows, general ML/DL workflows, and AI coding agents.

It provides:

- canonical project instructions with thin per-tool adapters;
- common ML/DL lifecycle guidance;
- LLM and Vision domain guidance;
- task-specific Skills;
- measured environment and resource detection;
- Google Colab execution and recovery policy;
- cross-platform installers;
- multilingual documentation and runtime resources;
- validation and installer test suites;
- reproducible training and experiment guidance.

## 🤖 Supported AI Development Tools

The repository provides project-level adapters, instruction files, Skills, or documented integration paths for a broad set of AI development tools.

- OpenAI Codex
- Claude Code
- Gemini CLI
- GitHub Copilot
- Cursor
- Windsurf
- Cline
- Continue
- JetBrains Junie
- Amazon Q Developer
- Aider

Support means that the repository contains a documented adapter, instruction file, Skill, or integration path for the tool. Tool capabilities and integration details can differ by client and version.

## 🐍 Supported Development Environments

| Environment / Tool | Support | Use case |
|---|---|---|
| Python | ✅ Core | Runtime detection, environment configuration, training, inference, validation, and automation |
| Jupyter Notebook | ✅ Supported | Interactive experiments, analysis, training, debugging, and reproducible notebook workflows |
| Google Colab | ✅ Supported | Ephemeral cloud notebook execution, resource-aware experiments, durable checkpoints, and recovery |
| Visual Studio Code | ✅ Supported | Python development, Jupyter notebooks, debugging, testing, and AI-assisted development |

### Platform support

| Platform | Role |
|---|---|
| Linux | Supported platform; the shell installer is designed for Linux-compatible environments |
| Ubuntu 24.04 LTS | Linux reference environment used by CI validation |
| macOS | Supported and validated by CI |
| Windows | Supported and validated with Windows PowerShell and PowerShell 7 |
| Google Colab | Supported as an ephemeral cloud execution target |

> **Important:** Linux is the supported platform category. **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS is the CI reference environment**, not a restriction that excludes other Linux distributions.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Clone the stable public distribution repository in the project you want to configure:

### Windows / PowerShell

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/eaglesjo/codingStandard.git
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\codingStandard\scripts\installers\install-domains.ps1 -Target .
```

Explicit language installation:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\codingStandard\scripts\installers\install-domains.ps1 -Target . -Language de -Domain all
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\codingStandard\scripts\installers\install-domains.ps1 -Target . -Language ko -Domain ml
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\codingStandard\scripts\install-domains.ps1 -Target . -Language ja -Domain llm
```

### Linux / macOS

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eaglesjo/codingStandard.git
bash ./codingStandard/scripts/installers/install-domains.sh .
```

Explicit installation:

```bash
bash ./codingStandard/scripts/installers/install-domains.sh . de all ask false
bash ./codingStandard/scripts/installers/install-domains.sh . ko ml overwrite false
bash ./codingStandard/scripts/installers/install-domains.sh . ja llm overwrite false
```

Arguments are:

```text
target language domain conflict-policy dry-run
```

Available domains:

```text
common | ml | llm | vision | colab | all
```

## 📦 Installation Domains

| Domain | Installs |
|---|---|
| `common` | Common only |
| `ml` | Common + general ML/DL lifecycle |
| `llm` | Common + LLM |
| `vision` | Common + Vision |
| `colab` | Common + Google Colab runtime policy |
| `all` | Common + ML + LLM + Vision + Colab |

Every successful install records ownership and hashes in `.codingstandard/installation.json`. See [`docs/development/INSTALLER_LIFECYCLE.md`](docs/development/INSTALLER_LIFECYCLE.md) for manifest and lifecycle behavior.

## 🧠 Environment, ML, and Colab Policy

Runtime decisions are based on measured capabilities rather than a named machine profile. The shared profiler considers OS, Python/runtime, CPU, RAM, disk, accelerators, VRAM, CUDA/ROCm/MPS/DirectML, precision capability, and Jupyter/Colab state.

For long-running ML work, use conservative runtime settings, Memory Smoke Tests, Early Stopping where meaningful, best Checkpoint, Resume, controlled ablation/experiment design, seed control, evaluation gates, resource tracking, and staged recovery from resource failures.

For Google Colab, `platform/colab/` treats the notebook VM as ephemeral: dependency bootstrap, measured resource resolution, smoke testing, durable checkpointing, artifact persistence, and resume validation are first-class controls.

## 🧩 Agent and Skill Routing

```text
Agent adapter
  ↓
AGENTS.md
  ↓
core/common
  ↓
ML / LLM / Vision domain
  ↓
Colab policy when applicable
  ↓
task-specific Skills
```

Cross-domain rules should be implemented once in `domains/ml/` rather than duplicated in each agent adapter or domain file.

## 🧪 Validation

Run the relevant checks before publishing a release:

```bash
python scripts/validation/validate.py
python scripts/validation/check_i18n.py
python scripts/installers/test_installers.py
```

The release gate also validates the architecture contract, environment contract, installers, and CPU LLM/Vision memory smoke tests.

### ☁️ Google Colab — one-click validation

Open the notebooks directly from GitHub in Google Colab. No private-repository credentials are required for the public distribution repository.

| Validation | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Full codingStandard | Runtime, environment, LLM/Vision smoke tests and repository validation |
| Clean runtime | Fresh-runtime environment and checkpoint/restore smoke test |
| LLM QLoRA | 4-bit/NF4 + PEFT/LoRA runtime validation |
| RAG | Dense embeddings + top-k retrieval + grounded prompt + generation |
