# Current Development State

This file is the durable handoff point for the active development task.

## Recovery contract

A new AI Developer session MUST treat repository state as authoritative and use this file to identify the last completed work and the next bounded action.

## Project

- Repository: `eaglesjo/codingStandard-dev`
- Canonical development branch: `main`
- Public release surface: `eaglesjo/AIEngineeringStandard`

## Active task

- ID: `MA-001`
- Title: Multi-Agent AI Developer 2.0 Architecture
- Status: `IN_PROGRESS`
- Goal: define and implement a bounded, vendor-neutral multi-agent development architecture for AI Engineering Standard 2.0.

## Current work branch

- Branch: `feat/multi-agent-ai-developer-v2`
- Base commit: `5ee47990419419a351afd3a92a5c538320660319`
- Integration PR: `#18`
- Previous integration: PR #17 — Development State Recovery v1

## Completed in the current task

- Expanded the 2.0 architecture to nine bounded specialist agents and the AI Developer orchestrator.
- Defined the three-stage relay: Analysis & Planning, Coding & Execution, Validation & Visualization.
- Added the normative Agent Contract and machine-readable schema.
- Added the Skill-to-Agent mapping with conservative capability boundaries.
- Implemented all nine bounded specialist agent surfaces.
- Defined the concrete Orchestrator control surface.
- Defined role permission ceilings, dispatch/acceptance gates, retry discipline, and lifecycle state authority.
- Added `scripts/validation/validate_agent_contract.py` for automated contract/orchestrator policy validation.
- Updated durable task state with the completed control-plane increment.

## Next bounded actions

1. Run automated Agent Contract/schema validation against the actual branch.
2. Validate representative end-to-end multi-agent flows.
3. Validate fresh-session recovery with multi-agent state.
4. Refresh PR #18 CI after the next bounded validation increment.
5. Merge only after required CI evidence is successful.

## Rules

- Never use chat history as the sole source of truth.
- Do not mark a task complete without repository or CI evidence.
- Do not overwrite historical decisions to make the current state look cleaner; record corrections explicitly.
- Keep agent boundaries role-based and vendor-neutral.
- Do not add agents merely to increase agent count; each agent needs a clear responsibility or permission boundary.
- Do not force all nine agents into every task; route only the agents required by acceptance criteria.
- Prefer parallel read-only work and single-owner overlapping writes.
- Freeze the candidate revision before independent parallel validation.
- On failure, preserve evidence and repair the smallest responsible boundary instead of restarting the full pipeline.
